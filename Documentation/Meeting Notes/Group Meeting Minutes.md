Updating rules:

  Everyone needs to comment and review (NOT merge) on every pull request for this week by 9pm tonight - note that Jared still needs to create a pull request for the documentation so that'll also require comments and reviews
 
  We've assigned the tasks for this week; we're primarily focusing on the database creation but Athena is setting up the mysql connection on the server and we've assigned you to create a front-end interface to show database results that are sent by the server
 
  All the issues are updated on the github for more info
