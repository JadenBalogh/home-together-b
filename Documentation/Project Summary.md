# Project Summary
Home Together is a non-profit hub for all things homesharing.

Home Together does not offer a particular service, but rather aims to maximize the number of people and services available in one place. Users can use the website to browse local homesharing services and find people in a particular geographical location, and filter these results by their specific needs.

General features include:
 - Search people and services that match an entered set of filters
 - Anonymous and secure sign up
 - Private no-risk messaging within the website, with email notifications
 - Rating system for both home sharers and listed services
