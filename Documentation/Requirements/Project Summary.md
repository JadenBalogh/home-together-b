# Project Summary
HomeTogether is the non-profit hub for all things home sharing. Differing from other for-profit enterprises in the same space HomeTogether aims to compete with nobody, by offering fair promotion of everyone.
 
Users can browse local services, search for potential housemates, connect with local classes and seminars, seek out legal advice, and more. Members will be able to communicate by username via a secure on site messaging system with the option to receive email notifications. Homesharers can filter potential housemates by factors like: working status, location, pets, budget, and more. Members will be able to review businesses and leave star-ratings on businesses and members. 
 
Businesses will be able to list via the classified system for a small fee taken via PayPal which helps cover site costs. Organizations and Members directly involved in home sharing (e.g Government Shared Housing Project) will be able to list for free. Businesses ads aka "Classifieds" and home-sharing ads aka "Service Listings" will be separated and then further organized into sub-categories such as "Home and Yard Services" for ease of browsing.
