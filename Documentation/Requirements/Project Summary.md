# Project Summary
Home Together is the non-profit hub for all things homesharing. It aims to not just offer a particular service but to bring together everything related to home sharing into one unified platform. Users can browse local homesharing services, look for potential housemates, and connect with local classes, seminars, and more. HomeTogether is aimed at everyone from the retired to the freshly graduated. Buisnesses will be able to list their services via the classified system, non-profits and community events will be able to list for free. Users will be able to filter for matches by things such as working status, location, pets and, budget. Users and businesses will be verified by site admins. User information is hidden from other users unless they explicity choose to share it with another user. They can communicate on site via a messaging system with e-mail notifications. Users will be able to rate other users and listed services.
