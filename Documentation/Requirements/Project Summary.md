# Project Summary
HomeTogether is the non-profit hub for all things home sharing. It aims to not just offer a platform for users to connect but to bring together everything related to home sharing. Users can browse local services such as cleaning and landscaping, look for potential housemates, connect with local classes and seminars, seek out legal advice, and more. Users and businesses will be verified by site admins and User information is hidden from other users unless they explicitly choose to share it. HomeTogether is aimed at everyone from the long retired to the freshly graduated. Businesses will be able to list their services via the classified system for a small fee which helps cover site costs. Not-for-profit organizations and events will be able to list for free. When looking for a housemate users will be able to filter by things such as working status, location, pets and, budget to assist people finding the perfect fit. Users will be able to communicate via a secure on site via a messaging system with e-mail notifications. If users choose to do so they can also share their private details via the same messaging service. Members of the site will also be able to rate and report other users and businesses.
