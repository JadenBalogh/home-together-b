# Tech Stack
MongoDB + Express.js + React.js + Node.js (MERN Stack)

## General Requirements:
Languages and Frameworks should be popular and widespread to better allow future developers to pick up where we left.
The use of common languages was requested by the client.

## Server / Hosting
Client has requested that the server is located in Canada. 
After October 20th, 2020 client meeting it has been determined that hosting is out of scope for this project. Hosting will be managed by the client. 

## Front-end Languages
### [HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language](https://html.spec.whatwg.org)
HTML 5 is the standard modern web markup language. It is understood by all modern web browsers by design and is a defacto web standard.

#### Pros:
* Easy to use and understand, human readable by design.
* All browers support basic HTML.
* Most develpment tools support HTML.
* HTML is a markup language easily modified and analyised by other programs.
* Search engine friendly, having accessable and proper HTML is important for SEO.
* Simple to edit, does not require any sort of compilation or virtual machine to run. Changes can be viewed in near real-time. 

#### Cons:
* Takes time to learn the syntax.
* HTML is very fault tolerant and so writing optimal can be tricky for people unfamiliar with it.

### [CSS - Cascading Style Sheets]https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
CSS is used to transform the raw markup in HTML into a dynamic stylization adjusted based on the users device and the designers intentions. It is a defacto web standard. 

#### Pros:
* Reusable, the same CSS can be applied to multiple HTML files to ensure design consistency.
* Easy maintenance, an external CSS file can be referenced by multiple HTML files allowing consistent changes throughout a design
* Search engine friendly.
* Fast webpage loading.
* Printer Friendly.

#### Cons:
* CSS can behave differently across multiple implimentations and so multiple browsers and clients need to be tested for compatibility.
* Need to pay attention to different level of CSS （e.g CSS2，CSS3， etc.）
 
### [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)
JavaScript is a scripting language.
 
#### Pros:
* Comparatively fast for the end user
* Platform independent
* Easy to debug and test
* Extended functionality to web pages
* Rich interfaces

#### Cons:
* Single Inheritance

## Front-end Framework
Frameworks should be popular and widespread to better allow future developers to pick up where we left; The use of common frameworks was requested by the client.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
React is a library that is mainly used for creating user interfaces.

#### Pros:
* Good choice in determining how the user will see the site
* Smaller size, loads faster 
* Fully backwards compatible, making it easier to pick up in the future
* Highly popular with developers, so more likely to find someone to pick the project up in the future

#### Cons:
* A huge library to import

## Back-end Framework
### [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
Express is a backend framework that is highly used, used by companies such as PayPal, Uber, and IBM.

#### Pros:

#### Pros:
* Uses user-readable rich JSON documents. 
* Uses JSON Querys giving more user-readable queries.
* Highly scalable, supports seamless horizontal scalability. 
* Provides high level APIs to work with data. 
* Does not require as much up-front design work, database can be adjust more on the fly than a traditional RDBMS database.

#### Cons:
* Less relaibality than an Atomic RDBMS implimentation. 
* Less performant for complex queries. 
* Less popular than MySQL databases. 
* MongoDB queries are less structured than tradtional SQL queries.
