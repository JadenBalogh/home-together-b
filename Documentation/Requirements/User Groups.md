# User Groups
Listed are the main user groups for HomeTogether.ca, users will come from all ages and all backgrounds and there will be no specific target demographic. A site for everyone from the freshly graduated to the long retired. 
 
1. Users who are looking for housemates. These users will enter their personal information and register on site thereby becoming Members. They will search the site for other members who match their criteria (Budget, Pets, Location, etc). Members will be able to message each other via the on-site messaging system and receive email notifications. Members will also be able to share their personal information with another member if they wish to do so. It is not shared by default.
 
2. Users who are looking for services. These users may not register on the site. They will be able to search the site for services, view reviews, leave reviews (if registered). Signup will be the same as users who are looking for housemates. As listings will simply host contact information (E-Mail, Phone Number) these users will not use the on-site messaging system. 
 
3. Businesses who are purchasing classified listings. These businesses will Verify with the site before they are able to post any advertisements. They will pay a small fee via PayPal to list their ads which helps cover site costs. They will have limited moderation powers over reviews on their own business (ability to report as fraudulent, etc). Some examples include: Lawn Care Services, for-profit legal assistance, rentals, and classes.
 
4. Individuals and Organizations who are posting service listings. These include things like: Co-ops, non-profits, members with homes to share and Government services. They will signup via a similar method as the business users and will also have to be verified however service listings do not require payment. Once approved they will be able to place "ads" for free. 
 
There may be overlap between groups:
Eg. User x may be looking for a housemate and to hire house cleaning services.
