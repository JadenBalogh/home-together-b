# User Groups
Listed are the main user groups for Home Together, users will come from all ages and all backgrounds and there will be not specific target demographic.

1. Users who are looking for housemates, these users may have a home or are looking for a home but the searching will be similar in most aspects. These users will search the site for other users who match their criteria. Users should specify if they are looking to bring someone into their home or if they are looking for a new home. 

2. Users who are looking for services, these may be people already living together or simply looking for services / community events. They will be able to search the site for services, view reviews, leave reviews. Signup will be the same as users who are looking for housemates. These users may not need an account, depending on the access requirements to view classifieds. 

3. Buisinesses who are selling services. These buisinesses will need to be verified before they are able to post any advertisements. They will be posting in paid classified categories and so will need to pay via pay-pal. They will need to have limited moderation powers over reviews on their own business (ability to report as fraudulent, etc).

4. Non-profits / Community organizers who are sharing information about themselves. They will signup via a similar method as the buiness users and will also have to be verified but they will be approved to place ads in the free categories of listings. They will share information and community events, community services, local classes, etc. 

There may be overlap between groups:
Eg. User x may be looking for a housemate and to hiring house cleaning services.
