# Tech Stack
The following frameworks are popular and widespread, so future developers will be able to pick up where we left off as requested by the client.

#Express.js backend
A backend framework that is highly used, used by companies such as PayPal, Uber, and IBM. Flexible, as features come in as plugins.
#React.js front end
React is a library that is mainly used for creating user interfaces.
#Angular.js front end
Angluar is a library for developing and testing single page applications. 
#Vue.js front end

--- MAP API ---
We researched:
1. https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/ (Apple MapKit JS aka Apple Maps)
2. https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Frameworks#Displaying_interactive_maps (OpenStreeMaps Dynamic Maps "Slippy Maps")
3. https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps (Google Cloud Maps Program aka Google Maps)

We rejected OpenStreetMaps due to the more complicated tech integration and the less popularity if/when the tech stack is passed on. 
Google Maps and Apple Maps have similar developer interest and documentation however the client would prefer Google Maps so that's the API we are planning to use.
