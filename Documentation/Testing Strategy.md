# Testing Strategy
Testing is crucial in our project to ensure changes don't break any code.

**Unit Testing**  
Unit testing is our primary approach to automated testing, and is required for every component created in our website. This allows us to ensure each component is giving the expected output.

**Integration Testing**  
Sometimes you need more than just checking the expected output of one individual component. Components need to work together and create the proper result on the webpage. To accomplish this, we use integration testing.

## Frameworks
We use the Jest and Enzyme frameworks for testing our React.js code.

See [this article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-test-react-components-using-jest-and-enzyme-fab851a43875) for an outline of using these testing frameworks for both Unit and Integration testing.
